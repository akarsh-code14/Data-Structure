        "\n",
        "    ->python dictionaries store data in keyvalue pairs,where each unique key maps to a specific value.This data structure is implemented as a hash table,which allows for efficient retrieval,insertion,and deletion of elements.\n",

        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "    ->Tuples in Python ensure data integrity primarily through their immutability. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary are hashable–they are generated by a hash function which generates a unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.\n",

        "\n",

        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Strings are immutable in Python, meaning their content cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify a string, such as concatenation or slicing, actually results in the creation of a new string object in memory, while the original string remains unchanged. The variable then points to this new string.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Dictionaries and lists are two fundamental data structures in Python, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. Dictionaries excel in scenarios requiring fast lookups, key-value associations, and complex data mappings, while lists are ideal for ordered collections, sequential processing, and simple data storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Tuples are immutable. Hence, they are primarily used to store data that doesn't change frequently. Any operation can store data in a tuple when you don't want it to change. Tuples are great to use if you want the data in your collection to be read-only, never to change, and always remain the same and constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Python sets are designed to store only unique elements. They inherently do not allow duplicate values. When attempting to add a duplicate element to a set, the set automatically disregards the new addition, ensuring that only one instance of that element exists within the set.\n",

        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> the in operation for the dictionary tests on keys. The key of the dictionary is a unique value as well as the set, and the execution time is about the same as for sets. On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list.\n",

        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->No, you cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in Python. Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. This immutability is a core characteristic of tuples.\n",
        "    \n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->A nested dictionary is a dictionary where at least one of the values is itself a dictionary. It's a way to represent hierarchical or structured data within a dictionary structure. This allows you to organize and access complex information efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->Accessing elements in a dictionary (also known as a hash map or associative array) typically has a time complexity of O(1) on average, which means it takes constant time regardless of the dictionary's size. This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally to store and retrieve data, and hash table lookups are generally very fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->For quick data look-ups, configurations, or caches, favor dictionaries. For ordered collections and sequence operations, such as maintaining a stack or queue, lists are more suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> dictionaries are unordered. When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change. Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.\n",

        "\n",
        "    ->In terms of data retrieval, lists and dictionaries differ significantly. Lists retrieve elements based on their numerical index (position), while dictionaries retrieve elements based on their unique keys. Lists are ordered collections, and dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.\n"
